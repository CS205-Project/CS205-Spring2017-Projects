  <h2 class="h2">Crossover of people</h2>
  <p>
  The evacuation strategy does not consider constraints on edges now. This is an interesting constraint to add to our problem. It is difficult to model because we would have to consider real time position of all the evacuees and assign them a penalty is their paths cross. If there would be too much crossing the simulated annealing would have to keep on annealing until it finds an optimal solution with minimal crossovers of people.

  <h2 class="h2">Visualization</h2>
  <p>
  To visualize real time evacuation of a building requires us to construct a visual graph from the random graphs generated that represent the floor plans. Then we would need to extract all paths, which we have already done. After that we would need to simulate everyone moving at every time step during every path, all simultaneously. We estimate that this would take us close to 2 weeks to achieve.
